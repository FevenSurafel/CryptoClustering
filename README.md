# CryptoClustering

This project applies unsupervised learning techniques, including K-means clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA), to analyze cryptocurrency data. The goal is to identify whether 24-hour and 7-day price changes influence cryptocurrency clustering patterns. Using Python libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, and hvPlot, the project normalizes the data, finds the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method, and visualizes the clusters before and after PCA.

The analysis reveals how clustering results vary based on different feature sets and highlights the importance of dimensionality reduction in unsupervised learning tasks.
